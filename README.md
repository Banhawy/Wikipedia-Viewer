# Wikipedia Viewer

[View Demo](https://banhawy.github.io/Wikipedia-Viewer/)

This is one of the front-end project challenges by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer).

This SPA is built with ReactJS and uses [Wikipedia's API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) to fetch query results entered by the user in the search box.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
